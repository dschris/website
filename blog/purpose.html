                    <p>What stage of the script of life are you in? For myself, and many of my peers, we're in the act where you're due to graduate college and be off to a full time job; likely that job will be one that you are going into based on a Co-Op or internship you were involved in. Or maybe you're continuing your education. This is typically less likely, and is often stereotyped into the realm of medical, law, or other degrees that are famous for their post-undergrad educational endeavours. And for many, the perception seems to be that graduate school is A) not easy and B) expensive. And hey, they're not wrong. But I think we may be missing a valuable piece of the equation.</p>

                    <p>What if this isn't what you want? In my personal observation, the less "likely" your path is, the less support that exists for it; the most generic of these paths being Primary Education -> High School -> College -> Employment -> Retirement. Barring some obvious details, this is the staple lifestyle that society frames and advertises to us through an onslaught of Colonial Penn commercials. I'm looking at you, Alex. But like I said, what if this isn't what you want? You could go to a trade school and become a certified electrician, plumber, mechanic, or so forth. All respectable skills as necessary now as a blacksmith was or bartender still is. But as you're ushered through high school, chances are your guidance counselor urged you to start applying to colleges before you had ever been asked what you really wanted to do. And even if you are a particularly aware 16 year old and thought about it, it's not likely you're gonna call it right on your first try. And how could you? You really don't get educated on your whole list of options. </p>

                    <p>My personal belief is that this undue pressure, especially for a high school student, is unfair. It is however a well and noble thought that everyone that completes high school will still be seeking some greater knowledge, in whatever that form may be. But it's obviously not the case, and the usual reaction we have to that is someone didn't want to work hard enough. Someone "couldn't hack it." Certainly we don't feel this way about a PhD. Society doesn't force that expectation upon you, and therefore, it's more of a personal choice. Clearly I'm not suggesting a PhD has the same attainability as an undergrad degree, but if you see my point bear with me.</p>

                    <p>Imagine if the same pressure to get a PhD was put upon your need for an undergrad degree? Do you think you still would have gone to college for one? I'm not saying it's likely the answer is no, because chances are if you are one of my peers you've suffered through so much in college in ways you never imagined were possible. And it has certainly helped to build your personal constitution and fortitude; you've likely become the kind of person that should be here college. </p>

                    <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

                    <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

                    <blockquote>The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

                    <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

                    <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

                    <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

                    <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
