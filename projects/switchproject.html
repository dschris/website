              <h3>Briefing</h3>
              <p>This project came very much out of necessity. After installing my CB radio in my Explorer, my radar detector, and interior LEDs, I was hard pressed for 12V outlets. Unfortunately for me this meant that any time I wanted to charge my phone I was unplugging my radar detector and leaving wires hanging in front of the head unit. While I was at a computer parts store in the area, I found a 5-port switch panel and the idea hit me - to mount the switch in the truck and connect all my devices. This also gave me a chance to offer some more permanent mounting solutions and hide my wires.</p>

              <h3>Getting Started</h3>
              <p>One of the first things you're going to need to assess is where you're going to locate your switch panel. One of my favorite things in a project like this is getting creative with the positioning. For the Explorer, I had already taken some panels apart previously and had a pretty good idea of what my options were. I recommend seeing what panels and pieces you can get to easily and remove completely without hours of work. The piece I chose to mount my switch panel to removed completely and tool-lessly. The piece you see in the first picture was a perfect fit for the switch panel without any grinding or cutting; just a slight amount of bending. The cubby seperates into two pieces: the inner piece with the two cubbies themselves, and the outter piece that acts as a frame and clicks into the console with plastic pins.

              <h3>Preparing the Cubby</h3>
              <p>I removed the inner piece and laid the outter piece aside (It won't be needed again until will put the cubby back inside of it when we finish up.) I took a large drill-bit and drilled through the back of the upper cubby with two side-by-side holes to leave an opening to run my wires through which you can see in the image on the right. I just made the hole large enough to make sure the quick-connects could fit through along with all the wires. It's a bit hard to see, but on the sides you can see where I drilled two holes on top of each other on either side of the cubby. After flexing the sides of the switch panel so they would bend in with the cubby I marked the holes for the screws in the cubby and drilled through. There was a fair amount of "eye-balling" that went on in this step due to the nature of the mounting job I was doing but everything mounted well on the first try and I didn't need to correct the holes.</p>

              <h3>Wiring the Switch</h3>
              <p>To wire the switch I daisy-chained the incoming 12V source which I vampire-tapped from the cigarette lighter across all of the switches which you can see on the bottom terminal of the switches in the image to the left. Then, coming off of each top terminal is a short length of wire just long enough to pass through the back of the cubby which has a male quick-disconnect crimped to it to allow you to add or remove devices without ever needing to remove the switch from the cubby. To further help with this I labeled each quick-disconnect with numbers 1 through 5 as you can see below. This corresponded with the switches going from left to right.The 16-gauge speaker wire was very easy to work with and very few lengths of wire were lost in the making of this project due to bad stripping!</p>

              <h3>Mounting</h3>
              <p>We already looked at most of what had to happen here in "Preparing the Cubby." All that's left to do here is pass the wires through the drilled hole in the back and line up the switch with the previously drilled holes. Because this switch was originally made for use in a computer bay (5.25") I didn't have mounting screws that were appropriate for this project. I took the switch to my local hardware store before I started and picked out a set of screws, nuts, and washers that were well-sized for the task. You can see that I chose flat-head screws with small washers, just enough to distribute the pressure on the plastic nicely and avoid the screws from pulling through. The image below on the left shows the cubby from the left side, and likewise for the right. Now we're free to mount the cubby back into the frame it came out of!</p>

              <h3>Conclusion</h3>
              <p>The last thing to do here is to create female quick-disconnects for the devices you want to power from the switch and plug them into the corresponding male quick-disconnect coming out of the back of the cubby. Then ground all of your devices to your location of choice. There was a bolt behind the cubby that I daisy-chained all of the grounds to. Once the devices were connected I just had to click the unit back into place and everything was live! All in all this was a pretty reasonable undertaking and only took a few short hours with a well worthwhile end result. I highly recommend doing a custom switch panel for anyone who has multiple components to power, especially radio guys.  </p>
