              <h3>Any Jeep Project Is a Good Project</h3>
              <br>
              <p>While it may just be a Patriot to some and never earn the title of being a "Real Jeep" to join the ranks of the Wrangler or XJ Cherokee, this vehicle's proven it's worth of the Jeep badge to me. I'm all about seeing what the Patriot's capable of doing and while I'm not ready to dedicate the time and energy to something more serious like a lift yet, I figured the light project would be a nice holdover. In addition to just being a nice aesthetic, the overhead lights have come in handy a few times while camping and off-roading. So let's get to it.</p>

              <h3>Getting Started</h3>
              <p>I had already mounted the lights to the gear basket over the weekend so I could split up the work. For my setup, the lights are mounted using a KC HiLites bracket directly to the top bar of the front of the roof basket. The wires from the lights terminate out the back of the housing to two weatherproof bullet connectors. I should mention one of the first things I also did here was remove the supplied black conduit from all of the wires and then re-applied it as necessary once all the wires were in place.</p>
              <br>:w

              <p> Since the lights came as sets of two, the relays are only designed to run two lights. I could have had one switch trip both relays, but I decided to opt for having each relay individually switched and wiring the lights in an inside-out configuration. In other words, one switch turns on the outter two lights; one switch turns on the inner two lights.

              <h3>Nobody Wants to See Your Wires</h3>
              <p>Once the lights were divided up as mentioned, I ran one set down the weatherstripping on either side of the Jeep. As you can see, Dad lended a helping hand and demonstrated the process. We pushed the weatherstripping back with a small flathead screwdriver and fed in the wire underneath it and then let it relax back into position. This step may vary depending on your vehicle, luckily for me the weatherstripping had a generous amount of space underneath, and ran all the way down under the hood into the engine compartment.</p>

              <h3>Mounting the Relays</h3>
              <p>Once the wires found their way to the engine compartment, I looked for a place to mount the relays. There's a metal lip in the picture to the left that I decided to use. It put the relays right up front near the relay box and battery which was helpful for getting my 12V source. Additionally, there was a nut in the same location I was able to use for my ground. (I promise the surface inbetween isn't painted.) After two self-tapping screws and the wires connected, all that was left was to run the wires to the switches in the cabin to trigger the relays.</p>

              <h3></h3>
              <p>Originally I had wanted to go through the firewall and bring the wires into the cabin using an existing grommet. Unfortunately for me, there were no grommets in a readily acccessible and friendly location, and I didn't feel like dropping the skid plate to access anything from the bottom. Instead, I found a grommet in the door jamb that was accessible through the fender. Unfortunately due to the angle it was difficult to get a picture of, but it's immediately behind the boot that has the electrical connections from the door coming into the jamb. After some wrist excercises and the help of a coat hanger I was able to pull the wires in from inside the fender and wire up the switches. </p>

              <h3>Conclusion</h3>
              <p>Here's a look under the steering column where I was working. The picture on the right is on the "outter wall" of the Jeep. There was a nut with an existing ground there so I used it for mine as well. The yellow wires run the to the switches in the cabin. As for a permament mounting position, I'm still debating. I didn't want to go cutting plastic or drilling holes just yet until I had a better idea of everything I needed to have wired up. I'm currently trying to come up with a good permanent mounting solution for my HAM radio as well. Once I mount the light switches permanently, I'll be sure to include a picture here! Thanks for reading! </p>
